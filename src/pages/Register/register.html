      One more thing before we sign you up to the collective, do you plan to sell any items on the Artists Collective?
      It is 100% free to create and advertise items, the collective will automatically deduct production and shipping
      costs from it, as well as handle orders and payments, then the profits are split 95% to the artist (you), and 5%
      to the collective (us). On creation of a product you can see the base cost of the product and are able to set your
      own price to determine what your profits will be.
